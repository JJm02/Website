        Although it welcomed visitors starting in 1999, the park was officially inaugurated on August 4, 2003, by YB Dato’ Seri Haji Mohd Sharif bin Haji Omar, who was the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry at the time.

        To enhance the visitor experience, the park includes amenities such as a walk-in aviary, bird sanctuary, gazebos, rest areas, food stalls, walking paths, a souvenir shop, a children's playground, and a designated prayer room.
